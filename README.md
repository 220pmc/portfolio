![chart](./docs/images/chart.png)

Welcome to my 2nd repository! I am Pok, a student from the University of Auckland who is learning `R`, `Markdown` and `SQL` language now.

After finishing the first half of my 2nd year school study, I would like to create this repository to conclude what I have learnt in the last semster.

In this repository, you can find the all the assignments from the course **Stats 220** in which I accuired skills in `R`, `Markdown` and `SQL` language.
